% GeffenMeister.m
% performs a trial-wise analysis of model fits as done in Geffen and Meister 2009
% usage
% [qx qy] = GeffenMeister(resp,pred)
% where resp and pred are matrices of equal sizes.
% resp is a matrix of the response data, where the short dimension indexes over trials. 
% this only works if resp is a matrix. so don't try this with vectors.  
% pred can be a matrix or a vector. if pred is a matrix, it will be averaged into a vector
