# Dynamical Adaptation

This document outlines all files in this project.

## 1. Filter Analysis

This document shows demonstrates the validtiy of the algorithms I use to reconstruct the linear filter from input-ouput data. Specifically, it has the following sections: 

* Overview of different regularisation methods.
* Synthetic Data with No regularisation
* Synthetic Data 1: effect of regluarisation (here the stimulus is white noise)
* Synthetic Data 2: effect of regularisation (here the stimulus is filtered white noise)
* Real Data 1: effect of regularisation (1-octen-3-ol flickering stimulus data)
* Real Data 2: effect of regularisation (fast odor flickering stimulus data)
* Real Data 3: effect of regularisation ("Natural stimulus" data)

The following figure shows that we can reconstruct the filter well:

## 2. Gain Analysis of 1-octen-3-ol flickering stimulus

In this document, we take one particular dataset (Carlotta's measuremnet of response of ab3 to 1-octen-3-ol) and check if a linear gain analysis can tell us if the neuron is adapting gain on a fast time scale. 

## 3. Analysis of "naturalistic stimulus"

## 4. Analysis of all of Carlotta's data

## 5. Spike Frequency Adaptation Models
