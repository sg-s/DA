# Dynamical Adaptation

This document lists key results, and the evidence we have for them. 

## A LN model predicts the response of ORNs to Gaussian inputs well

## A LN model cannot account for responses to Gaussian inputs with different means

### With increasing mean of Gaussian input, neuron responses speed-up

### With increasing mean of Gaussian input, neuron gain goes down

### Gain changes cannot be explained by a static nonlinearity 

## Responses to naturalistic stimuli 


## Chrimson Results ??




## Secondary results

### There are two timescales in the step adaptation response

### Extracellular Spike amplitude varies with response intensity 

## Open Questions / Next Steps

### What determines spike amplitude? What causes "pinching"?

### Do ORNs show power-law variance adaptation? 

### Why are ORN spike amplitudes different? 

### Why do ORNs spike spontaneously?
