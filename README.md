# Dynamical Adaptation

This document outlines all files in this project.

## 1. Filter Analysis

This document shows demonstrates the validtiy of the algorithms I use to reconstruct the linear filter from input-ouput data. Specifically, it has the following sections: 

* Overview of different regularisation methods.
* Synthetic Data with No regularisation
* Synthetic Data 1: effect of regluarisation (here the stimulus is white noise)
* Synthetic Data 2: effect of regularisation (here the stimulus is filtered white noise)
* Real Data 1: effect of regularisation (1-octen-3-ol flickering stimulus data)
* Real Data 2: effect of regularisation (fast odor flickering stimulus data)
* Real Data 3: effect of regularisation ("Natural stimulus" data)


## 2. Effect of Correlation Time on Linear Filters
How does the correlation timescale of the stimulus affect the shape of the filter we back out of the data? In this document, I show that: 


## 3. Gain Analysis of 1-octen-3-ol flickering stimulus

In this document, we take one particular dataset (Carlotta's measuremnet of response of ab3 to 1-octen-3-ol) and check if a linear gain analysis can tell us if the neuron is adapting gain on a fast time scale. 



## 3. Analysis of "naturalistic stimulus"

## 4. Analysis of all of Carlotta's data

For most of Carlotta's data, the ORN is compeltely silent for most of the time, and the normal methods of gain analysis won't work so well. here we try to use other methods. 

## 5. Spike Frequency Adaptation Models
