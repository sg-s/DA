# things to talk to damon about 

1. where does the power law with exponent come from? precise citation? 
2. In Nagel-Wilson, if LFP ~ transmembrane current, then doesn't the decay of LFP to a step show adaptation?
3. in reachr experiments, different filter shapes prob. not important. 
4. 3rd timescale in DA model? (because there are two timescales in the step adaptation response)
