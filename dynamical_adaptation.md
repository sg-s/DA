# Dynamical Adaptation

The following outline sketches all the possible results we could talk about in this project. 

## 1) Evidence of Dynamical Adaptation in flickering stimulus

* 1-octen-3-ol flickering stimulus (Carlotta).
* linear fit, gain analysis 
* linear fit vs. NL vs LN fit
* linear fit vs. DA fit 

## 2) Dynamical Adaptation in other flickering stimulus

* flickering stimulus from Carlotta's data where ORN response goes to zero
* gain analysis as in `1)` no longer possible. 
* instead, plot amplitude of response to each pulse as a function of time since last pulse, or some other metric. 
* compare linear fit to LN, NL fits. 
* DA fit. does it fit better? 

## 3) Dynamical Adaptation in naturalistic stimuli
* responses of ab3 and ab2 to "natural" stimuli (Mahmut)
* linear fit vs. NL vs. LN
* gain analysis with NL fit?
* DA fit, gain analysis with same?
* a whiff-based gain analysis?
