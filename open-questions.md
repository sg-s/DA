# Open Questions

## Step On Adaptation 

When presented with a step-on of odour, ORNs fire with a transient peak, and then a steady state. What governs the ratio of the the peak to the steady state? 

* Why is the degree of adaptation different for odour and light activated channels?
* Is the degree of adaptation different for different odours?
* Is the degree of adaptation different for different ORs/ORNs?
* Both the DA model and Liu-Wang model make predictions about the relationship between the degree of adaptation and the time-scale of adaptation. Which fits better? Are they the same? How can we expand this to two timescales? 

## Spike Amplitudes

What determines the spike amplitude of a ORN recorded extracellularly?

* Why do ORNs pinch? We know that strong activation is not required for them to pinch. Prolonged activation can also work. 
* When does only A pinch, and when do both pinch? We know that A can pinch independently of B. 
* Is pinching linked to the LFP? Does the change in LFP indicate a change in the adaptation state of the neuron? 
* We know ORN pinching has nothing to do with odours-- we can make ORNs pinch with light activated channels. 

## The Coupling between A and B

C-YS showed that two ORNs in the same sensilla driven by different inputs can inhibit each other ephatically. However, we never see this because 

1. we never use two odours/two independent stimuli that activate A and B independently 
2. the stimuli we use actually weakly activates B (ethyl acetate)

* Given a fluctuating monomolecular signal delivered to a sensillum (ab3), we see that A and B firing is actually highly correlated. Why? How does this sit with C-YS' result?
