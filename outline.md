# Dynamical Adaptation

## Outline

### Do ORNs modulate gain?

#### Gain modulation in 1-octen-3-ol

Linear Models systematically mis-estimate gains as a function of recent stimulus. 

#### Gain Modulation in other receptors/odors 

Linear gain analysis doesn't work for most other cases because the ORN's firing rate goes to zero. We need a new way of analysisng gain for these cases.

### Can we explain it?
