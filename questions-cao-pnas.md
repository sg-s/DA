# Unresolved questions about Cao et al. PNAS 2016

2. Why do they see weird, bursting oscillations in ORN responses (e.g. Fig 2A, 3B). This has never been observed in the intact system, or in their own recordings in cell-attached mode (Fig. S1D)
3. What causes the difference in response kinetics between Or and Ir-expressing ORNs in Fig. 4? Are they sure the stimulus has the same kinetics? 
4. Are all traces shown in Fig. 5A real, or are some of them schematics? Responses to 1mM pulses on a 4mM background in Fig. 5A have no noise at all. Why? Why are only three points plotted for 4mM background in Fig. 5B, when 7 traces are shown? 
5. How are traces in Fig. 5C normalized? It doesn't appear to be by peak. 
6. If there are 7 different points in Fig. 5D, why don't these points appear in Fig. 5B? 
7. Assuming the neuron in Fig. 6 is ab3A (personal communication from last author), why are offset responses in Fig. 6C so different from Fig. 4C? These are the same neuron type responding to the same odorant. 
8. Are the response kinetics different in Fig. 6D when Calcium is removed? Not clear from figure, but it appears so. 
9. How are these curves normalized in Fig. 7B? Does normalizing them differently maintain the cross-over? 
10. Fig S2C. It looks like the firing rate of the Ir-expressing ORN is decreasing to a step stimulus. Is this correct? Firing rates not plotted. This contradicts many other claims that Irs don't adapt, e.g. Fig. 4E.
11. Fig S3B. How are these dose-response curves normalised? They don't appear to be normalised. 
12. Fig S3C shows that the response kinetics are identical with and without Calcium. However, this doesn't seem to be the case for Fig. 6D [see point 8]
13. Fig S3D. Offset responses of ab3A ORNs to ethyl propionate are inverted, similar to Fig. 6, but contradicting Fig. 4. What is different, and why?
