Insects use olfaction to find food and mates. Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) on their antennae must control their gain in response to the distribution of odor stimuli, to avoid both missing small stimuli and saturating to large stimuli. ORNs must also control gain on timescales constrained by flickering odor stimuli encountered by foraging insects on the wing. 

Here we examine how the gain in the response of an ORN changes over time scales from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. To do this we stimulated ORNs with random flickering odor stimuli with controlled distributions and fit ORN responses with Linear-Nonlinear models that capture filtering and gain properties. Our experimental and numerical methods revealed three novel features of phenemology of ORN responses to odors. 

First, we find that ORN gain decreases with increasing stimulus intensity. On presenting flickering stimuli with similar variances but increasing means, we show that ORN gain decreases with stimulus mean, in a manner similar to the Weber-Fechner Law. 

Second, ORNs speed-up responses to odor stimuli of increasing intensity.  Analysis of the cross-correlation function and of filter shapes show that ORNs respond faster to flickering odor stimuli with larger means, consistent with the gain-bandwidth tradeoff in electronic amplifiers.  

Third, ORNs can control gain on a fast time scale. By examining the responses of ORNs to flickering stimuli in at times when the stimulus is locally low, or locally large, we can estimate the ORN's time-dependent gain. This analysis reveals that gain can vary threefold on timescales as short as 500ms. 

Olfactory modulation of flight in Drosophila is rapid, occurring within 85ms of onset of odor transduction. Odor cues encountered by flying insects are  temporally patterned and depend on odor and environment. Our results suggest that ORNs can dynamically vary their gain in a stimulus-driven manner, which may help insects localise olfactory sources.
