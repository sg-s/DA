Gain control is a critical feature of many sensory systems. Sensory systems control gain in response to stimulus distributions to avoid both errors of omission and of saturation. Gain is also controlled on timescales constrained by the temporal structure of natural stimuli. In this study we investigate how Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) in Drosophila change their gain in response to olfactory stimuli. 

We examine how the gain in the response of an ORN changes over time scales from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. To do this we stimulated ORNs with random flickering odor stimuli with controlled distributions and fit ORN responses with Linear-Nonlinear models that capture filtering and gain properties. Our experimental and numerical methods revealed three novel features of ORN responses to odors. 

First, we find that ORN gain decreases with increasing stimulus intensity. On presenting flickering stimuli with similar variances but increasing means, we show that ORN gain decreases with stimulus mean, in a manner similar to the Weber-Fechner Law. 

Second, ORNs speed-up responses to odor stimuli of increasing intensity.  Analysis of the cross-correlation function and of filter shapes show that ORNs respond faster to flickering odor stimuli with larger means, consistent with the gain-bandwidth tradeoff in electronic amplifiers.  

Third, ORNs can control gain on a fast time scale. By examining the responses of ORNs to flickering stimuli at times when the stimulus is locally low, or locally large, we can estimate the ORN's time-dependent gain. This analysis reveals that gain can vary fourfold on short timescales.

Olfactory modulation of flight in Drosophila is rapid, occurring within 85ms of onset of odor transduction. Odor cues encountered by flying insects are  temporally patterned and depend on odor and environment. Our results suggest that ORNs can dynamically vary their gain in a stimulus-driven manner, which may help insects navigate olfactory sources.
