Data to collect: 

1. steps of increasing concentration (carlotta)
2. steps of increasing concentration on a background 
3. pseudo-random noise (carlotta)
4. synthetic plume experiments 


(minimum) list of figures:

1. responses to single pulses of different intensities (various odours, various ORNs)

   -- fit DA model to data, compare fits to linear and LN model 
   -- plot response time vs amplitude for all models 
   -- compare dose-response plots 

2.  responses to single pulses of different intensities on top of backgrounds of different intensities (	various odours, various ORNs)

	-- fit DA model to data, compare fits with linear and LN model
	-- plot peak response vs. step intensity for different backgrounds (data + DA fit)
	-- plot sensitivity vs. background concentration (data + DA fit)
	-- plot peak time vs. background concentration (data + DA fit)
	-- Weber-Fechner Law: plot the peak ORN response to a chosen probe stimulus as a function of background odour concentration, and group by probe amplitude. 

3. Responses to pseudo-random noise (different odours, various ORNs)

	-- plot stimulus + data + DA fit + linear fit + LN model fit 
	-- Gain analysis for (DA, linear, LN) models @ one history length
	-- gain analysis for (DA, linear, LN) models @ many history length
	-- how well does timescale from DA model fit match with timescale from linear model gain analysis?
