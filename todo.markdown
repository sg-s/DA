gain analysis with valve instead of with PID for fast odours. 

bootstrap fit slopes

remove quadratic term from PID, but don't remove anything form the firing rates

fit DA model to dose-response experiments, concatenate data, build framework to fit single model (either linear model or DA model) to many pieces of data
