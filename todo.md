figure out why loops--if LN model fits, there should be no loops. make an interactive Gain Anqt=ysis function that takes the data, and you can vary the histroy length, etc. 

update matrix: 

plot against stimulus

figure out how to quantify loopiness: update amtrix: eigenvalues of x(t+1) = Ax(t)
 

construct a stimulus that is mahmut's flickering stimulus + background, figure out how to vary the height of the background

criteria for pikcing points:

if, at a certain history length, the smoothed stimulus is closer to a straight line than to the actual stimulus, we shouldn't pick it. 

on the other extrmee, history lengths need to be sufficiently long so that the responses and prediction isn't confined to a small part of the space.
